			<h2 id="aboutMe">About Me</h2>
			<p>My name is Jim Hughes.  I was born and raised in central Illinois.  Carving is one of my many passions. I am a  multimedia artist. Working  mostly in antler , with some wood, shell, and fossil  ivory as well. While  I've  always  enjoyed  art. Carving  is more of  a new found love. I was lured by the challenge. Everything  about  the art seemed full of limitations.  Then you add the limits  of irregular  shaped material  like antler. I was sold.
			<br>			
			<p>On March 1 of 2013, I decided to make that passion a career.  I quit my manufacturing  job  of  18 years to pursue.  With no real training. I set out to learn. My work  wasn't  very good. I was  selling a lot of " trinkets " at fairs, and craft shows. Mostly  I was just trying  to learn. And make enough money  to  feed the madness. I am still trying  to learn every day. There is no substitute  for hard work, and hours vested.
			<br>
			<p>Along the way. I have met many great artists. So many have given helpful  advice,  critique,  and inspiration.  Sometimes  I  don't know  what  I  do to deserve  it. But, I am thankful.</p>
			<br>
			<p>In August  of this year (2015) . My family  and  I packed up. We left Illinois  in search of greener pastures. We landed in ozark country. A land filled with inspiration.  Ready to write our next chapter.</p>

          <p>I am in awe of the carver's vision to see a shape within a solid form. Jim releases shapes ~ both naturalistic and fanciful ~ with amazing detail & creativity. I treasure the two feathers I have that Jim made of antler & horn.</p>

          <p>Jim Hughes is an amazing artist.  I have purchased multiple pieces from him and love them all.  His work shows amazing detail; I have a necklace of foot prints in the sand and you can see the detail in every sea shell and even the grains of sand. I receive so many complements when I wear this piece as well as all the other pieces of jewelry I have purchased from him.  I asked him to do a piece for our daughter’s wedding and the piece he designed and created for the alter, was a beautiful angel out of an elk antler and mounted her on a beautiful piece of wood.  I have also purchased several of his ornaments, they give a flare of “old fashioned” to my tree.  My daughters absolutely loved them so I bought them each one for their trees as well.  Jim Hughes is a very talented artist and will always be my favorite!</p>

			<p>Each of these artworks are a huge undertaking.  It takes many hours to design, and complete one piece.  Some are done from Alaskan moose antler; while others are from the Shiras moose.</p>

			<p>Each feather is carefully hand carved from the outer scale of elk antler. I start with a blank cut from the main beam, or a tine. Depending on the size or shape that I am looking for. I must follow the twists and curves that the natural material gives me. They are my favorite type of art pieces to work on. The possibilities are endless.</p>

			<p>I really enjoy doing these small works.  They are just the right size that you can pack them full of details.  Netsuke, is useful art form that has evolved in Japan over a period of around 300 years. My work would fall into more of a "new school" netsuke.</p>
